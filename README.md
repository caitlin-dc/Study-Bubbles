# Study-Bubbles
According to Anxiety and Depression Association **of America, **over 80% of U.S. students report feeling stressed over school**. In another study, students reported being distracted an average of 37% of the time** that they work on their schoolwork.

:bubbles: :bubble: Study Bubbles aims to help with both of these metrics. Study Bubbles is an app which motivates, focuses, and destresses students by taking a gentle approach to studying and working online with friends.

## Personal Bubble
Students have the option of creating a personal bubble that they can focus in. Within this bubble, they are told how long they have studied and positive affirmations. The student can also put a goal at the top of the bubble, with the bubble-wand, to further motivate them. All of these features are to create a gentle distraction from the student using their phone as a distraction.

## Group Bubble
If students want to work together or study with friends, one person can start a group bubble and share their unique code with their peers and share a bubble. This lets them stay motivated as they see that their friends are studying, too! Furthwermore, there is an optional chat feature within the group bubble, with a cool down, to allow flexibility between staying focused but also motivating each other. 

## Self-Care Bubble
Even when students are not studying, they need to know their mental health is a priority. With the self-care bubble, the user can input how they are feeling and get a positive affirmation to tell themselves. Furthermore, they can follow the timer for breathing exercises to focus on resetting their mind and relaxing. 

Education should be a positive and enriching experience for students and not a source of stress. Study Bubbles aims to give that positive redirection and support for anyone who chooses to use the app!
